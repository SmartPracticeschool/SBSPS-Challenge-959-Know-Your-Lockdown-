<ul>
 <li>An Interactive dashboard which visualizes data on the Indian Map drilled down to each district. It shows the sentiments of people regarding lockdown (Positive, Negative, Neutral), mental health of population during lockdown & live patient count. The website will allow the government to know which region faces which problems(Food Shortage, Transportation, Economic, Daily services, Others ).</li>

 <li>It is a one stop destination to get an overview of the effect of COVID-19 in India. Reports can be generated as required to find general trends by applying various filters ( eg: date wise filter to find how each state/district reacted in the particular time period).</li>
